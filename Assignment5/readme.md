## Assignment 2

# Reverse First 5 Elements of a List

This Python script extracts the first five elements from a list and reverses their order.

## How to Use

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The program will create a new list with the first five elements reversed.
3. The reversed list will be displayed in the console.

## Example Output

```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Code Explanation

- A predefined list `my_list` contains numbers from 1 to 10.
- The first five elements are extracted into `new_list`.
- A loop swaps elements to reverse the order of `new_list`.
- The final reversed list is printed.
